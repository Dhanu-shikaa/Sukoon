To avoid query misclassification, we can use POS tagging to count verbs or noun. Based on the verb or noun count, employing unigram for simple queries, bigrams for moderately complex ones, or n-grams for more intricate requests. This approach tailors the classification method to the query's complexity, potentially improving accuracy.
